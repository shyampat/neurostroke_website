                <h2> What are the types of stroke?</h2>
                <p>Stroke can be caused either by a clot obstructing the flow of blood to the brain (called an <a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/types-of-stroke/ischemic-stroke-clots"> ischemic stroke </a>) or by a blood vessel rupturing and preventing blood flow to the brain (called a <a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/types-of-stroke/hemorrhagic-strokes-bleeds">hemorrhagic stroke</a>). A TIA (<a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/types-of-stroke/tia-transient-ischemic-attack">transient ischemic attack</a>), or "mini stroke", is caused by a temporary clot.</p>
                <p> Some strokes are talked about below. </p>

                <h1> Ischemic Stroke (Clots)</h1>
                <p>Occurs when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is obstructed. It accounts for 87 % of all strokes.</p>
                <p>Fatty deposits lining the vessel walls, called atherosclerosis, are the main cause for ischemic stroke. Fatty deposits can cause two types of obstruction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cerebral thrombosis is a thrombus (blood clot) that develops at the fatty plaque within the blood vessel.</li>
                    <li>Cerebral embolism is a blood clot that forms at another location in the circulatory system, usually the heart and large arteries of the upper chest and neck. Part of the blood clot breaks loose, enters the bloodstream and travels through the brain’s blood vessels until it reaches vessels too small to let it pass. A main cause of embolism is an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. It can cause clots to form in the heart, dislodge and travel to the brain.</li>

                <h1> Hemorrhagic Stroke (Bleeds)</h1>
                <p>Occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures. The two types of weakened blood vessels that usually cause hemorrhagic stroke are aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The most common cause of hemorrhagic stroke is uncontrolled high blood pressure.</p>
                <p>Hemorrhagic strokes make up about 13 % of stroke cases. They're caused by a weakened vessel that ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain. The blood accumulates and compresses the surrounding brain tissue.</p>

                <h1> Cryptogenic Stroke</h1>
                <p>In most cases, a stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood to the brain. In some instances, despite testing, the cause of a stroke can’t be determined. This is called a cryptogenic stroke.</p>
                <p>Because approximately 1 in 4 stroke survivors will likely have another stroke event, finding the cause of the stroke will help your physician treat the cause of your stroke and lower the likelihood of another. Having a cryptogenic stroke may be frustrating and overwhelming, but with a proper diagnostic workup and collaboration with your healthcare team, you can take part in finding the cause of your stroke and help prevent another one from occurring.</p>
                <p> It’s estimated that about 1 in 3 ischemic strokes are cryptogenic. </p>

                <h1> Brain Stem Stroke</h1>
                <p>Brain stem strokes can have complex symptoms, and they can be difficult to diagnose. A person may have vertigo, dizziness and severe imbalance without the hallmark of most strokes — weakness on one side of the body. The symptoms of vertigo dizziness or imbalance usually occur together; dizziness alone is not a sign of stroke. A brain stem stroke can also cause double vision, slurred speech and decreased consciousness.</p>
                <p>Only a half-inch in diameter, the brain stem controls all basic activities of the central nervous system: consciousness, blood pressure and breathing. All motor control for the body flows through it. Brain stem strokes can impair any or all of these functions. More severe brain stem strokes can cause locked-in syndrome, a condition in which survivors can move only their eye. <p>
                <p>If a stroke in the brain stem results from a clot, the faster blood flow can be restored, the better the chances for recovery. Patients should receive treatment as soon as possible for the best recovery.</p>

                <p>The brain is an extremely complex organ that controls various body functions. If a stroke occurs and blood flow can't reach the region that controls a particular body function, that part of the body won't work as it should.</p>
